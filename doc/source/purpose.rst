Insights from Biology
====================
Essential to all autonomous creatures is the ability to sense the surrouding environment.  Evolution has delveloped complicated structures to help organisms gain knowledge about the physical state of the world.  Creatures lacking in advanced sensory systems are more likely at to fall victim to harsh reality of nature. One of the hallmarks of *advanced* lifeforms are highly evolved sensory systems.  Sensory *receptors* are diverse and vary with species and environment.  Senses can be classified into groups:

- Vision (Sight)
- Auditory (Hearing)
- Olfaction & Gustation ( Smell & Taste)
- Mechanoreception (Touch & Pressure Sensing)
- Equilibrium & Balance
- Acceleration 
- Thermoreception (Temperature)
- Chronoreception (Time)
- Echolocation
- Magnetorecpetion
- **Electroreception**

Electroreception
----------------
I have chosen to highlight electroreception because it will be the focus of this project.  We will be attemption to mimic the ability of some species of fish to percieve the electrical properties of their environement.  Most notable is the group of fish belonging to the `Gymnotiformes <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnotiformes>`_ and `Mormyridae <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormyrids>`_ families; these species use special *electric organs* to actively create electric fields that propagate in the murky waters they call home.  Sensory cells along the skin of these fish allow then to detect tiny disturbances in this field which the can use it identify competitors, mates, predators and prey.
